            <div class="char-childhood">
                <h2>Childhood</h2>
                <p>Xie Lian was born as the only son to the King and Queen of the prosperous Xianle Kingdom. As a kid, he liked going on swings, reading unpopular books, drawing, as well as building and knocking over golden toy block houses.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The prince wanted nothing and was beloved throughout the kingdom. While he was a bit strange, not caring for politics or money, he was strong in his belief that he would be able to help the common people. He studied cultivation from a young age at the renowned Royal Holy Pavilion while his bodyguard and friend, Feng Xin, was at his side. It was there that he met one of his future generals, Mu QIng. Mu Qing worked as a servant at the temple, and only with Xie Lian's recommendation was he given the chance to study cultivation.</p>
                <br>
                <p>During his time as the crown prince of Xianle, Xie Lian was at the forefront of the parade playing the part of a warrior in a performance for the crowd. Celebrating the heavens and as a symbol of the kingdom's prosperity, the festival and Xie Lian's performance was highly regarded as an icon of the kingdom. However, it was cut short as Xie Lian abandoned his performance halfway through to save a child who fell off the palace walls, later revealed to be Hua Cheng as a child.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="char-firstasc">
                <h2>First Ascension</h2>
                <div class="quote">
                    <span>"When people said you were a god, then you were a god. If they said you were a shit, then you were a shit. Whatever the people said you were, that was what you became. It had always been like this."</span>
                </div>
                <br>

                <h4>Fall of Xianle</h4>
                <p>With his country at the brink of war, against the word of Jun Wu, Xie Lian descended to the Human Realm to assist the people. However, it is against the rules of Heaven to descend to the human realm without express permission, lest tragedy befalls the humans. No matter how hard the prince tried, everything he did to help only seemed to make matters worse. In the end, fires and a plague called the Human Face Disease spread across the nation, and the rebel armies lay siege to the Imperial City. Although he had meant only to help his people, he had unintentionally been the one to lead the nation to its end.</p>
                <br>

                <div class="quote">
                    <span>"Because the Kingdom of Xianle was destined to fall. Since you raised your hand and messed up this game of chess, then, there will for sure be another hand that returns all the messed up pieces back in place."</span>
                </div>
                <br>

                <p>The mentioned plague was caused by a being called White No-Face. Xie Lian didn't know what he wanted, but White No-Face continued to pyschologically torment Xie Lian throughout and even after the fall of the nation. It is later revealed that Xie Lian is the reason behind the creation of White No-Face.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After the unfortunate fall of the Xianle nation, Xie Lian felt the blow from both the humans and the gods. Where he was once widely worshiped with thousands of shrines, he was now seen as the "Demon God" who had destroyed the nation.</p>
                <br>
                <p>From the Heavens, he received the punishment of banishment, along with the destruction of his cultivation. He was forced back to the Human Realm with a Cursed Shackle now adorning his neck in form of a collar.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="char-firstbanishment">
                <h2>First Banishment</h2>
                <p>After his first banishment, Xie Lian was forced to live in the mortal realm where his kingdom had been overtaken by Yong'an. He lived in a simple shack with his mother, father, Mu Qing, and Feng Xin. Life was hard and work was so difficult to come by that Xie Lian was forced to sell his prized legendary swords and later resorted to street performance and even attempted robbery.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The first person to leave was Mu Qing, stating that he could not take care of his mother as well as them and that he thought he had a solution to their current dilemma.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Shocked from Mu Qing's departure, Xie Lian wandered the riverside and realized it's Zhongyuan. He happened upon a dark man trying to scam some local children into buying his eerie lanterns, marketing them as rare treasures that would fulfill their wishes. Xie Lian revealed the mans false promises, that the lanterns held trapped ghosts that would cling to them once they brought them home. After scaring away the children, Xie Lian learned the man captured the ghosts in the lanterns from the battlefield. He bargained with the man to sell him the lanterns with what little money he had. He then released the trapped ghosts by the shore and performed a service for them. One of these ghosts recognized Xie Lian and refused to be sent off. It claimed to have an attachment to this world, that they had a beloved they wished to protect. Xie Lian tried to urge the ghost to move on, reasoning that his beloved might feel guilty that the ghost couldn't rest in peace because of them. However, the ghost was resolute and claimed he would then not let their beloved find out. He also did not blame Xie Lian for their loss in battle and claimed that he is Xie Lian's most devoted believer. Xie Lian doesnt believe him.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Xie Lian, his parents, and Feng Xin fled to another city, whereupon Xie Lian learned his father's health has taken a turn for the worse. Desperate, Xie Lian pawned Hong Jing, a sword gifted to him by Jun Wu, to buy medicine for his father. During the trip into the town, Xie Lian, alongside Feng Xin, come across a spectacle where a servant turned against their master and beat them publicly. Shaken by the event, Xie Lian later gifts his last golden belt to Feng Xin, claiming it was compensation for what he's owed Feng Xin for so long.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Once they exhausted all the items they could pawn, the two turned to busking secretly. It payed well for a while until they were met with a mob of other local street performers that bullied them off their turf. With no other means left to make money, Xie Lian turned to robbery without telling Feng Xin. His internal struggles about the deed kept him from robbing most travelers that passed by until he finally pushed himself to mug a traveler on a mountain road. Unfortunately, the man ran off before Xie Lian could burgle him, yelling for help with Xie Lian giving chase to quiet him. The traveler ran past a group of heavenly officials and from his screams, the officials figured out the situation. Xie Lian was horrified but the officials assured him they wouldn't tell anyone. On the way back, Xie Lian glimpsed a white silhouette that he thought had been wearing a mask.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Uneasy from the events of the day, that night Xie Lian awoke from his slumber and wandered over to a graveyard. He came across a tombstone with offerings of wine. It was a cold night, so thinking that the wine would warm him up, Xie Lian drank from it and became intoxicated.[6] A ghost fire appeared, circling him, trying to come near him but would pass through him every time. Xie Lian thought it was the master of the grave trying to chase him away, so he tried to leave but, in his daze, he tumbled into the pre-dug grave. Disheveled and frustrated, he cursed and yelled for help, too disoriented to climb out. He huddled in the grave from the cold and the ghost fire flew to him, pressing close but unable to warm him. Xie Lian thought he heard a voice begging for more time.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Later, when Xie Lian went to a mountaintop with potent spiritual energy, he was cornered by 33 gods who humiliated and bullied him, Mu Qing being one of the people involved as well. Following the incident, he visited again with a sack of rice and offered assistance but was turned away. A tiny ghost fire was also present at the mountain, trying to help Xie Lian by crashing itself to the other Heavenly Officials but he harmlessly bounced off them.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After the humiliation, Xie Lian started to lose control of his temper and emotions. The issue was worsened by White No-Face's return and taunting, in which he conjured illusions of his mask and robes that were only visible to Xie Lian. Xie Lian tried to warn his parents and Feng Xin about White No-Face's return which in turn just made them worry about his health. Angered that they didn't believe him, Xie Lian left the house and rejected Feng Xin who ran after him. It was in this state that he saw White No-Face again and gave chase deep into a forest. A wall of ghost fires led by one particularly bright ghost fire attempted to stop him, but Xie Lian brushed them off and continued walking until he reached a Flower Crowned Martial God Temple.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="char-piercedbahs">
                <h2>Pierced by a Hundred Swords</h2>
                <p>Xie Lian waited for White No-Face to appear in this Temple but only normal people came in, confused and lost in the fog, until there were about a hundred people in the temple. White No-Face then released a man with the Human Face Disease into the crowd and informed them that the only way to be immune from the disease was to have murdered before. He then pointed out that Xie Lian was an immortal and thus could be killed indefinitely, granting the crowd immunity against the disease.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The people began to rise up and 'kill' Xie Lian, stabbing him in fatal areas. Xie Lian, bound to the altar and stabbed repeatedly, couldn't even shout for help and could only beg mentally for someone to help him or for the release of death. Eventually, his consciousness shattered with a final call for help. With this, the ghost fire that had been following Xie Lian burst into flames and burned every living being in the temple, taking the form of a young man and kneeling in front of the lifeless Xie Lian.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When Xie Lian regained consciousness, he descended the mountain with the sword used to stab him, Fang Xin, gifted by White No-Face. From here, he lost his values and principles, descending down a darker path of violence and robbery, losing control of his emotions as well. Feng Xin, appalled and frustrated, tried to reason with Xie Lian but to no avail, ultimately leaving the household.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The next day, Xie Lian woke up to find that his parents had hung themselves with a silk bandage. Falling into despair, Xie Lian tried to do the same but his immortality didn't allow him to die. After hanging there for a while, Xie Lian fell from the noose as the silk bandage had come loose. It had gained consciousness after being stained by the blood of two royals and Xie Lian, a spiritual weapon born from his and his parent's despair. He then realized the festive atmosphere outside his window, celebrating the new Yong'an. Rage and hatred burned inside of him and he took the mantle of White No-Face to avenge Xianle.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="char-birthoswnf">
                <h2>Birth of Second White No-Face</h2>
                <p>Donning the white mask and white robes, he came to the battlefield where he called the spirits of the fallen Xianle warriors, promising them revenge and keeping them in Fang Xin. He meant to release all the spirits in Yong'an and cause a second outbreak of the Human Face Disease. One of the spirits that heeded his call was a nameless yet immensely powerful malicious ghost in black robes that he called Wuming.</p>
                <br>
                <p>They went to the Yong'an palace to kill Lang Ying, the king of Yong'an; however, they found that he hand intentionally infected himself with the Human Face Disease to preserve the spirits of his wife and child, dying from the disease shortly after Xie Lian appeared in front of him. Angered by this, Xie Lian killed Lang Ying's young cousin, heir to the throne of Yong'an, before burning the palace. He went to Lang-er Bay, planning to release the spirits trapped in Fang Xin there and causing a second outbreak of Human Face Disease.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In Lang-er Bay he met White No-Face once again, who taunted him before disappearing. Rather than immediately releasing the disease, Xie Lian decided to do so at the sunset of the third day. He decided to test the people one last time, stabbing himself and collapsing on the street, waiting to see if anyone would come and save him.</p>
                <br>
                <p>By the afternoon of the third day no one had come to help Xie Lian, in fear of his title as the 'God of Misfortune.' If anything, he was cursed by a farmer passing by who tripped onto him and fell, spilling the content of his rice sack. His heart finally set on revenge, he was about to pick up Fang Xin and release the resentful spirits. At this moment, the same farmer who had cussed at him held his own bamboo hat over Xie Lian's face to shield the rain, before pulling him up and telling Xie Lian to go home. With this one act of kindness, all hatred left Xie Lian's heart, redirected towards White No-Face instead.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Xie Lian tried to fight White No-Face but lost, and he was forced by White No-Face to release the resentful spirits. He was prepared to take the wrath of all the spirits in place of the people, but all spirits were unexpectedly drawn away. Wuming had called the spirits to himself to save Xie Lian, and his remaining soul was dispersed in the process.</p>
                <br>
                <p>With a roar of thunder signaling a Heavenly Calamity, Jun Wu appeared and fought against White No-Face, defeating him. After the ordeal, Xie Lian was released of the cursed shackles representing his banishment from Heaven and ascended once more.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="char-secondaasb">
                <h2>Second Ascension and Second Banishment</h2>
                <p>After he ascended for the second time following White No-Face's defeat, Xie Lian asked Jun Wu to banish him back to earth. He felt that heaven attained on the death of his last believer was a heaven not deserved.</p>
                <br>
                <p>That day, the heavens shook as the reascended Flower Crowned Martial God fought the Heavenly Emperor in an all-out, no barred duel. In the end, the Crown Prince was defeated and banished back to the mortal realm, and besides banishment, he requested two new cursed shackles; one for blocking spiritual powers and one to disperse all his luck, to atone for his sins. His second ascension took less than the time it took to burn an incense stick to end.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>State Perceptor of Yong'an</h4>
                <p>This event took place 500 years after the Second Banishment and 300 years before his third ascension.</p>

                <p>Xie Lian, who was a street performer at the time, intercepted a brawl between a group of kidnappers and the imperial guards with a tree branch to save the crown prince of Yong'an. The king and queen were so grateful that they persuaded him to stay in the palace until his arms healed, during which period they discovered Xie Lian's mastery over swords and scholarly arts. They then persuaded him to become a Head Priest and teacher to the Crown Prince, Lang Qianqiu.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Xie Lian, now also known as "Fang Xin Guoshi", carried out his duties and taught Lang Qianqiu for six years. For the duration of his role as Guoshi of Yong'an, Xie Lian was remarked to be cold and distant, always wearing a white gold mask that hid his feature. During these years, it was clear that Lang Qianqiu idolized his master. But on the Gilded Banquet of the crown prince's seventeenth birthday, he saw his master killing the king.</p>
                <br>
                <p>All of this was, in fact, a scheme by Qi Rong and An Le, the last remaining descendant of Xianle's royal family. They wanted to take the throne and rebuild Xianle but in order to do that, a coup needed to happen. An Le and a group of Xianle supporters massacred the Yong'an royalty in the Gilded Banquet but before they could kill the wounded king, Xie Lian appeared and stopped them.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The King who was a Xianle sympathizer felt betrayed and demanded Xie Lian tell the guard to massacre all people of Xianle descent. To protect the common people, Xie Lian killed the king of Yong'an. Lang Qianqiu was late and only saw the scene of his master killing his father.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Afterward, Xie Lian confronted An Le and had his identity discovered. An Le was ecstatic, telling him about their plan to overturn the kingdom of Yong'an and rebuild Xianle. Xie Lian asked what he thought would happen to the people of Xianle who had finally begun to assimilate into Yong'an after long years of discrimination. Knowing that An Le would let them all suffer for his ambition, Xie Lian killed him using sword reverberation that liquefied his organs and made it look like An Le died from a disease.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Xie Lian then claimed responsibility for the Yong'an massacre. He escaped and was hunted by Lang Qianqiu who finally caught him. Lang Qianqiu, in his anger, stabbed his master through the heart and into a three-layered coffin. He then buried Xie Lian alive.</p>
                <br>
                <h4>General of Yong'an</h4>
                <p>Xie Lian managed to escape the three-layered coffin after one hundred years. As he couldn't stay in the East, which was Lang Qianqiu's domain, he took a compass and journeyed northward. It was only after he found himself nearing the Gobi Desert that he realized his compass was broken. Xie Lian decided it was a good place as any and settled down near the Banyue Kingdom.</p>
                <br>
                <p>At that time, skirmishes between Banyue Kingdom and Yong'an were so frequent and so severe the army kept losing men. Xie Lian joined the ranks of Yong'an and quickly gained respect among the army for his bravery and strength, gaining the title of general in no time. This title was gained by stopping the Banyue soldiers from killing Yong'an civilians. However, Xie Lian would also stop his own men from killing Banyue civilians, causing him to lose popularity and went from a captain of hundreds, to fifty, to twenty.</p>
                <br>
                <p>One day as he was cooking in his helmet, one of the soldiers was so aggrieved by the smell he kicked the helmet and spilled everything. It was how Xie Lian met Ban Yue, the future State Preceptor of Banyue Kingdom, back when she was a street orphan who ate Xie Lian's cooking off the ground and immediately got sick.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After they met, the two became close with Ban Yue shadowing Xie Lian everywhere. Even later when she became the State Preceptor of Banyue that respect never went away. In order to save Ban Yue, Xie Lian even joined in a clash between the two armies but fell because his shoe tie came loose and got trampled to "death" by the two armies.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Deciding this is a good way as any to fake his death, Xie Lian left the borderland.</p>

                <h2>Third Ascension</h2>
                <p>For hundreds of years, Xie Lian continued to live an earnest, simple life in the mortal realm. He tried doing various jobs, but due to his bad luck it didn't work out well, so he stuck to collecting scraps. This earned him the nickname of "Scrap-Collecting Immortal" or simply "Scrap Immortal". For the nights, he usually searched for a cave to sleep in. His temples, along with his once revered status, became long forgotten with time, although his story of being the dear crown prince of Xianle quickly spread around the mortal realm and became one of the Four Famous Tales.</p>
                <br>
                <p>800 years after his first ascension, Xie Lian ascended for the third time. The exact reason for his ascension is unknown, but it shook the Heavens so greatly that golden palaces crumbled and an ancient clock fell from its place.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="char-ghostbg">
                <h2>Ghost Bridegroom</h2>
                <p>Due to the damages caused by his ascension, Ling Wen explains that Xie Lian has to pay a debt of eight million, eight hundred and eighty thousand merits. Shortly after, he visits the communication array of the Upper Court, where he meets Feng Xin and Mu Qing again. Feng Xin's palace had been destroyed by the ascension, while Mu Qing was almost hit by the bell, making for an awkward reunion.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Afterwards, Ling Wen gives him aid by giving Xie Lian a mission in the north.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Xie Lian goes to Yu Jun Mountain for the assignment and settles inside a tea shop. He sees a silver butterfly that he gets shortly distracted by before he meets the Middle Court officials Nan Feng and Fu Yao that have also the arrived at the tea shop. Both claim to have come willingly to accompany him on the mission.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Xie Lian explains that in the past century, seventeen brides had gone missing, and that a being called the "ghost bridegroom" is responsible for it. Before getting on the case, the three of them search for shelter in one of Nan Yang's temples, where they shortly meet a girl called Xiao-Ying.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Later on, he disguises himself as the bride to take the bait. That night he sits in a sedan guarded by Nan Feng, Fu Yao and some military officials. Xie Lian hears a child singing, then his sedan gets attacked by wolves and base slaves. He defends himself with Ruoye, Xie Lian then tells everyone to leave the scene in order the ghost bridegroom can take him. He waits for a bit, suddenly a hand pulls up the curtain and extends the other one towards him.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Xie Lian takes his hand hesitantly, the young man leads him to a Ming Guang temple while he holds an umbrella above them to be shielded from the pouring blood rain. Xie Lian was about to apprehend him with Ruoye but the young man shatters into many silver butterflies.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Xie Lian goes inside the Ming Guang temple, which is Pei Ming's, and finds the 17 missing brides. A black fog enters the temple, Xie Lian assumes it's the ghost bridegroom and attacks them, but they flee outside. He chases it but finds Nan Feng, Fu Yao, a youngster's gang and Xiao-Ying. Xie Lian thinks the ghost has blended with the crowd.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The group of people enter inside the temple to sell the missing brides, the leader gropes one of the deceased women and Xiao-Ying tries to stop him. The youngster knocks her down, and suddenly a stone hits the leader. He figures out it's the bandaged child from outside the window. Xiao-Ying explains to Xie Lian that the child can't be the ghost bridegroom and when the people tried to build Ming Guang temples they got burned down quickly. Thus they settled on Nan Yang temples. Xie Lian realizes the ghost is hiding among the dead brides because there are now 18.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Suddenly, the deceased women attack them. Xie Lian draws a protection circle with Ruoye for the mortals and stays in the temple to fend them off. Nan Feng goes to the forest to retrieve the dead brides. Xie Lian contacts Ling Wen if Pei Ming had any possessive lover who was disabled. She answers that it's Xuan Ji before getting cut off.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Xuan Ji appears before Xie Lian on her knees, furious Pei Ming hasn't showed up yet. Xie Lian successfully apprehends Xuan Ji, though Xiao-Pengtou and Xiao-Ying lose their life during the battle. General Pei Jr. arrives shortly after and arrests Xuan Ji.</p>
