                <h2>Weapons</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Wraith Butterflies: </b><span>In Hua Cheng's control, the butterflies become quite a versatile tool. They are capable of great offense as a swarm of them can take down many powerful enemies and also work as a nigh-impenetrable defense. These butterflies can also do recon work such as scouting an area, spying on targets, turning invisible, record & edit and also work as communication devices. Some butterflies even have the capability to heal wounds.</span></li>

                    <li><b>E-Ming: </b><span>Hua Cheng's sentient scimitar that he often treats like a disobedient dog. This weapon was famous for being incredibly wicked, with an oppressive sense of evil and malice. One slash from E-Ming and his enemy will be poisoned to death. In the case that they survive, Hua Cheng can order the healed wound to open again at his will and kill his enemy from a distance. A truly terrifying weapon.</span></li>
                    <br>
                    <li><b>Distance Shortening Array Dice: </b><span>He has a pair of dice that when rolled allows him to transport to different locations while predicting danger ahead.</span></li>
