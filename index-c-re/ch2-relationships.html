                <h2>Family</h2>
                <br>
                <h4>Xie Lian</h4>
                <p>Xie Lian is Hua Cheng's reason for living and later, his husband.</p>
                <br>
                <p>They first met when Hua Cheng was a child and Xie Lian played the God-Pleasing Warrior during the Heavenly Ceremonial Procession. Hua Cheng wanted to take his life that day by jumping down the city walls during the parade, but he became enchanted when he saw Xie Lian. He ended up falling accidentally because he wanted a closer look, but was caught by Xie Lian.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When he was young, Hua Cheng had no will to keep going in life, but once Xie Lian heard of this in a temple, he told Hua Cheng to use him as a reason for living. Hua Cheng took those words to heart and swore to never forget Xie Lian even after most of his worshippers had turned on him.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Hua Cheng's loyalty and love persisted for centuries, so much so that he was Xie Lian's only believer at some point after the world forgot him. He ultimately comes back from death or dissipating three times for Xie Lian, wishing to never rest in peace so he can always return to him. He would do anything for Xie Lian, willing to be a stepping stone or a servant for him, and he would never oppose Xie Lian's decisions.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In the present, Hua Cheng goes out of his way to spend a lot fo time with Xie Lian once he finds him. He is seen as cold and merciless by other Heavenly Officials, but is very kind, supportive and gentle when with Xie Lian, causing other gods to be shocked. When the two enter a romantic relationship, he is a passionate lover and heavily dislikes being away from Xie Lian.</p>

            <div class="char-allies">
                <h2>Allies</h2>
                <br>
                <h4>Yin Yu</h4>
                <p>Yin Yu is Hua Cheng's assistant and takes the place of his right-hand man. Hua Cheng respects him and the work he does, having trust in his abilities and timing.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Citizens of the Ghost City</h4>
                <p>While the citizens of the ghost city highly fear Hua Cheng, they also genuinely respect and admire him. Whenever he needs help, they are more than willing to help him. They even helped during the fight against White No-Face by joining humans and heavenly officials in protecting the spiritual array against the swarm of Corpse-Eating Rats. They frequently shower him with praises and gifts, though Hua Cheng is largely indifferent to them. However, he has never treated them badly.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="char-heavenlyofficials">
                <h2>Heavenly Officials</h2>
                <br>
                <h4>Mu Qing and Feng Xin</h4>
                <p>Hua Cheng has despised Mu Qing and Feng Xin for a long time, who in return also grew to dislike him because Hua Cheng would frequently get into fights with them on the days of the Ghost Festival.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Mu Qing and Feng Xin are initally creeped out by Hua Cheng's affection for Xie Lian due to his century long obsession with him. Yet when it seemed like Hua Cheng had died after the fight with White No-Face, Mu Qing screamed for Hua Cheng to come back and Feng Xin was asking if he could be saved because his death greatly saddened Xie Lian, demonstrating their care for Xie Lian's happiness with Hua Cheng over their distaste for him.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Between Mu Qing and Feng Xin, it is implied he despises Mu Qing more, even thinking he isn't worth saving from death. This is mainly because he was the one who kicked him out of the army. Mu Qing claims it was to save his life because children often died in the war and Hua Cheng himself was very young. Hua Cheng, however, firmly believes it was Mu Qing was jealous that Xie Lian praised Hua Cheng's swordsmanship skills. In addition, Mu Qing was with the thirty-three Heavenly Officials who humiliated Xie Lian over a piece of cultivated land.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Hua Cheng seems amused whenever Mu Qing and Feng Xin start fighting, wishing to witness them beating each other to death. After his return following the final fight, he seems more indifferent towards the two though, even calling them over when Xie Lian was in pain.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h4>Jun Wu</h4>
                <p>He distrusts and dislikes Jun Wu, feeling like he doesn't care for Xie Lian as he had banished him twice from the heavens and even placed the shackles on Xie Lian that dispersed his luck. He is the only person able to talk bad about Jun Wu without repercussion. In turn, Jun Wu seems to view him as a formidable enemy, forbidding the other officials from getting into a fight with him. Despite this, he initially doesn't seem to mind Xie Lian and Hua Cheng's friendly relationship. Hua Cheng ultimately helped Xie Lian take Jun Wu down once and for all.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="char-ghosts">
                <h2>Ghosts</h2>
                <br>
                <h4>He Xuan</h4>
                <p>The two share a neutral relationship. While it’s not clear if they are friends, the two have allied with each other, as He Xuan helped Hua Cheng gather information in the Heavens while Hua Cheng helped him exact revenge on Shi Wudu. He Xuan also helped Hua Cheng by allowing him and Xie Lian to bring injured Heavenly officials to his Black Water Lair during the battle against the Heavenly Capital and disguising himself as Hua Cheng to check up on the human array. Hua Cheng states this is because he owes him a massive debt.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Qi Rong</h4>
                <p>Hua Cheng has contempt for Qi Rong. According to him, Qi Rong should not be part of the Four Great Calamities as he has not reached the Supreme rank.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Hua Cheng also believes that Qi Rong's existence is useless and revolting, especially since Qi Rong eats human flesh. Qi Rong also has a record of imitating ghost kings, such as Hua Cheng with blood rain. Because Qi Rong doesn't understand how Hua Cheng does blood rain, he hangs corpses and lets the blood drip from the bodies, fueling Hua Cheng's distaste for him even more.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="char-humans">
                <h2>Humans</h2>
                <br>
                <h4>Shi Qingxuan</h4>
                <p>While he does not consider him a friend, he seems to at least be able to tolerate his presence, being far less annoyed with him than with any other Heavenly official. This is most likely because he is one of the few gods to treat Xie Lian with genuine friendliness and respect. Despite this, Hua Cheng did work with He Xuan to murder Ming Yi and help him impersonate Ming Yi in order to seek vengeance against Shi Wudu and Shi Qingxuan for the misfortune they caused him.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="char-weapons">
                <h2>Weapons</h2>
                <br>
                <h4>E-Ming</h4>
                <p>E-Ming is his sabre, made with Hua Cheng's own right eye. Despite its fearsome reputation and being Hua Cheng's main weapon, it is submissive to its master, who often bullies him. E-Ming is greatly fond of Xie Lian and enjoys the attention Xie Lian showers on it, especially when he pets him. As a result, Hua Cheng tends to have a childish jealousy towards his own weapon, often pushing it to the side, so he can regain Xie Lian's undivided attention and affection.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Ruoye</h4>
                <p>While Hua Cheng does not have much interaction with Xie Lian's weapon, Ruoye seems to trust Hua Cheng. Ruoye is capable of detecting evil spirits and acting to protect Xie Lian. When Xie Lian first met Hua Cheng during the Ghost Bridegroom mission, he did attack Hua Cheng, only for Hua Cheng to disperse into butterflies. Later, when Xie Lian was caught in a sandstorm and commanded Ruoye to grab onto something strong and reliable, he grabbed onto Hua Cheng. Even after Hua Cheng's identity as one of the four great calamities is revealed, Ruoye never attacks him, most likely due to Xie Lian's deep trust in him.</p>
                <br>
                <p>While Hua Cheng seems to place trust in Ruoye's abilities to protect Xie Lian, it is implied that Hua Cheng is mildly jealous of the weapon's close relationship to him. Notably, during the Amnesia incident, when Xie Lian lost his memories and San Lang was following him around, once Xie Lian became suspicious of Hua Cheng, Hua Cheng used the excuse that he followed Xie Lian because there was a cursed object on him. He kept a firm grip on Ruoye to prevent it from returning to its master and even used a chopstick to pin it down, stating it had petty habits and needed to be trained. He went so far as to toss the piece of white silk to the floor, using an unknown method to keep it down.</p>
