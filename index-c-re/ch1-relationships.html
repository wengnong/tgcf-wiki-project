            <div class="char-family">
                <h2>Family</h2>
                <br>
                <h4>Hua Cheng</h4>
                <p>Hua Cheng is his husband and lover, as well as his most devoted believer. The two meet in the present time as Xie Lian is heading back to Puqi Shrine and manages to hitchhike on the cart of an old man heading the same direction. Hua Cheng was sitting on that cart and managed to strike up a conversation with Xie Lian, who immediately grew to like him due to his intelligence and knowledge. When Hua Cheng, whom he introduces himself as San Lang, claims to be the son of a noble family and was kicked out, Xie Lian happily welcomes the man to live with him. The two get along well and live together in peace before Xie Lian needs to go on another mission. Even then, San Lang accompanies him and helps him out.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Over the course of the novel, Hua Cheng continues to support and care for him. Unlike most other Heavenly Officials who so much as fear the mention of Hua Cheng, and are disgusted and in fear of him, Xie Lian considers him adorable. Hua Cheng has had strong feelings for Xie Lian since their mortal lives, and is implied to have loved him since they first met. Xie Lian himself loves Hua Cheng so much he is hardly able to refuse him anything.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Qi Rong</h4>
                <p>Xie Lian shares a strained relationship with Qi Rong, his younger cousin who was once deeply loyal and infatuated with him before the fall on Xianle. Despite his intentions to gain Xie Lian's attention and approval, Qi Rong's method often involved in cruel and violent actions as he sought justice for Xie Lian.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This led to Xie Lian often being annoyed by Qi Rong's unreasonable and irresponsible nature. Some events even enraged him, such as Qi Rong brutally abusing Hong'er, for which he demanded Qi Rong's arrest and stricter discipline in his upbringing.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Despite this, Xie Lian also cared for Qi Rong as his little cousin during his time as the Crown Prince. Xie Lian and his mother were the only people who made an attempt to not wrong nor ignore him intentionally unlike other members of the royal family.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Xie Lian discovered that Qi Rong was bullied by the kids from his branch of the family, who pulled a malicious prank on him using the prayer lamp. Xie Lian broke the lamp and personally rewrote the prayers himself, and no one dared to play any tricks on Qi Rong after that. Xie Lian also rushed to rescue Qi Rong when he was kidnapped during the Civil War of Xianle.</p>
                <br>
                <p>After the war between Yong'an and Xianle, Xie Lian didn't seem to know about what happened to Qi Rong and had accepted that he died in the war like other royal family members. Upon their reunion after his third ascension, Xie Lian is shocked to have learned of Qi Rong's deeds, such as developing a cannibalistic nature and vulgarity. When Qi Rong discovers Xie Lian's identity as Fangxin Guoshi, he hurls insults and provocations, trying anything to get Xie Lian to snap.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Aware of Qi Rong's madness, Xie Lian initially refrains from engaging, but when Qi Rong insults Hua Cheng over his blind eye, Xie Lian punches him in the face. Xie Lian's annoyance and shock turns into resentment, a feeling that was mutual for a long time. The only reason Xie Lian was mostly tame with Qi Rong was because of Gu Zi, as he didn't want to hurt his father's body which was possessed by Qi Rong.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Mother</h4>
                <p>A kind woman who loved him deeply and hated seeing her loved ones suffering. She was just as about as bad a cook as Xie Lian. After her passing, Xie Lian also started to name his culinary attempts in her memory.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Father</h4>
                <p>When Xie Lian was little, he looked up immensely to his father, believing he was the best king in the entire world, one that would go down to history. However, as he grew up he quickly realised his father was no different from the average person and begins to question his decisions and beliefs. When he was only a teenager, training on Mount Taicang, Xie Lian spends more time with his mother than his father during his rare visits and tends to avoid speaking to his father. His father dislikes his son seeing him weak and dyed his grey hairs black before going to pray at his son's temples.</p>

                <h2>Heavenly Officials</h2>
                <br>
                <h4>Feng Xin</h4>
                <p>Feng Xin is Xie Lian's former bodyguard, a position he acquired when he was 14. After Xie Lian ascended, he became a deputy general and Xie Lian's attendant. He was extremely loyal to Xie Lian, trusting and supporting him. Xie Lian relieved Feng Xin of his duties during his first banishment, not meeting him again until his third ascension eight hundred years later. Feng Xin still cared for Xie Lian, although he was hesitant to express so at first.</p>
                <br>
                <p>By the end of the novel, they have reconciled and are good friends once again. He pays visits to Xie Lian when he is waiting for Hua Cheng's return, sometimes together with Mu Qing. He and the latter would also help out Xie Lian during Hua Cheng's birthday and the amnesia incident.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Mu Qing</h4>
                <p>He is Xie Lian's former servant and deputy general. Although they got along and Mu Qing followed Xie Lian alongside Feng Xin, Mu Qing ultimately left Xie Lian after his first banishment to take care of his mother.</p>
                <br>
                <p>At the end of the book, he expresses that all he wished for is to become his friend. Xie Lian holds no grudges towards him, and in fact, saves him when he faces the danger of falling into lava.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The two have a steady friendship by the end of the book. He also fixes Ruoye for Xie Lian which has torn in two during the final battle and pays multiple visits to Xie Lian together with Feng Xin.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h4>Jun Wu</h4>
                <p>Jun Wu first met Xie Lian when he defeated the demon of the Yi Nian Bridge. He was so impressed by Xie Lian that he took off his disguise as a mortal Taoist and showed his true form as the Heavenly Emperor. After returning to Heaven, he told the gods that Xie Lian has a great potential.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Jun Wu favored Xie Lian above any other Heavenly Official and in return Xie Lian respected him immensely. When asked, Xie Lian named Jun Wu alongside Mei Nianqing and Hua Cheng as the three people he trusts unconditionally.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Shi Qingxuan</h4>
                <p>Shi Qingxuan is one of Xie Lian's closest friends and allies. He first meets Shi Qingxuan on on his mission in Banyue, although they only really start to talk to each other after Shi Qingxuan defends him during the following trial in the Palace of Divine Might. Shi Qingxuan quickly warms up to Xie Lian, treating him with enthusiastic kindness and not caring about Xie Lian's status as the laughing stock of the three realms.</p>
                <br>
                <p>They often help each other out throughout the story and Xie Lian was devastated after Shi Qingxuan's disappearance, always keeping him in the back of his mind and trying to find his whereabouts. They later reunite and continue to have a strong friendship by the end of the novel. Shi Qingxuan has mentioned him as his second best friend.</p>
                <br>
                
                <h4>Pei Ming</h4>
                <p>They first met after the Banyue Pass incident, although they have both heard much about each other beforehand. While Pei Ming didn't detest him, he was still suspicious of Xie Lian since he was involved in the cases of his subordinate's scandal being exposed and the incident at the Black Water Island, but those negative feelings were faint and short lived. Xie Lian respects Pei Ming and was relatively indifferent about him, although it's mentioned that he's quote curious about his person and would read the inappropriate tales about Pei Ming if it wasn't for his cultivation path. Despite that, he's often unsettled by Pei Ming's laid back nature and the way he talks to Hua Cheng. By the end of the novel they have become close allies and have a friendly relationship.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Of all characters, Pei Ming seems to be the one most supportive of Xie Lian's and Hua Cheng's romantic relationship.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Yushi Huang</h4>
                <p>She was the one who lent him a spiritual device that provided rain so he could relieve the drought in Yong'an, although they didn't meet each other until 800 years later. She helped him and his comrades out during the Tonglu Mountain mission and they have a friendly, respectful relationship with one another. Yushi Huang frequently gifts him vegetables from her agricultural work.</p>

                <h4>Mei Nianqing</h4>
                <p>Mei Nianqing was his teacher during his childhood in Xianle. He has always been supportive of Xie Lian, but he was also very worried about him. They remain good friends by the end of the novel, to the point that in an extra Xie Lian went to him for advice on what to give Hua Cheng for his birthday.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Yin Yu</h4>
                <p>Xie Lian met Yin Yu in Ghost City for the first time, where Yin Yu escorted him to Hua Cheng's Paradise Manor. That day he noticed Yin Yu's Cursed Shackle and was quite curious about it. He doesn't meet him again for a long time, but after they do interact they seem to get along well quickly. Xie Lian often mentions how little presence Yin Yu has, even mistaking him for He Xuan at one point. He feels bad for everything that has happened to Yin Yu and cheers him on when he's faced against Jun Wu, praising and admiring his noble and moral character.</p>

                <h4>White No-Face</h4>
                <p>Even after 800 years, Xie Lian is still afraid of him.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Ban Yue</h4>
                <p>Xie Lian was once the lieutenant of the Banyue army. He got acquainted with the child, Ban Yue, after she ate some of Xie Lian's spilled cooking since she was starving. He was mistaken dead after saving her, but they are reunited once more when Xie Lian goes to investigate the Banyue ruins several centuries later. The two remain close friends as she often helps him in the times of need and highly respects him.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>Lang Ying</h4>
                <p>Lang Ying was taken in by Xie Lian after the events of Yu Jun Mountain. Xie Lian took on a sort of guardian role for Lang Ying, wanting to teach him cultivation and buying him clothes. Lang Ying was grateful and slowly got used to the life at Puqi Shrine, opening up more and more over time. Once he learned from White No-Face that Xie Lian was the reason for Yong'an's fall and decided to get revenge, he sacrificed his life and let himself be devoured by Bai Wuxiang. Xie Lian, though hurt by his betrayal, still cared for him and mourned for his death.</p>
                <br>

                <h4>He Xuan</h4>
                <p>He Xuan and Xie Lian shares a neutral relationship. He Xuan in disguise as Ming Yi had accompanied in many missions with Shi Qingxuan along with Xie Lian and Hua Cheng although he had mentioned it wasn't his will. He Xuan drank soup made by Xie Lian at Puqi Shrine which made him faint.</p>

                <p>Xie Lian tried numerous times to help Lang Ying and his kingdom. However, Xie Lian soon felt resentment when he kept winning battles against Xianle. He tried to get revenge after his parents ended their lives, but Lang Ying died before Xie Lian could do the deed. Surprisingly, Lang Ying holds no hatred against Xie Lian.</p>

                <p>As the spiritual weapon born from Xie Lian's parent's suicide and Xie Lian's own bungled suicide, Ruoye from the start was affectionate towards its master. While Xie Lian was at first resentful towards the spiritual weapon and pushed it away as it was a reminder of his parent's deaths, but he did eventually grow close to it. He often used it to capture and bind enemies or as part of a snack charming act during some of his many street performances to earn money. Ruoye is loyal to Xie Lian and always listens to his commands, except for the instances where it is asked to bind and capture a woman, as Ruoye enjoys wrapping itself arond beautiful women and tends to be docile and less willing to return to its master. Nonetheless, Xie Lian cares for Ruoye and heavily relies on it during battle, placing great faith in it. He also lets it wrap around his body to rest, displaying his trust that it won't harm him.</p>
